## A project assignment for data analysts.

# Task 1

Context
We believe that our product is expensive enough for the customer.
We have a hypothesis that reducing the price of the product
will increase the frequency of sales
and increase the profitability of the product overall.
        
Test
We conduct a test,
in which the control is
the sale of the product with the old price,
and the test is the sale of the product with the new price.
The purpose of this test
is to test the hypothesis of an increase in profitability
of our product due to a decrease in the tariff.

Statistical Inputs
5% significance level.
We would like to distinguish between a 5%
change in the target metric
With a probability of 80%.

# Task 2

Context
The Central Bank has relaxed the rule,
wich limiting the options for selling the service.
We want to try
a more aggressive sale of the service,
but we are afraid,
that it will affect the economics of the core product (CC - credit card)
Because of customer negativity.

Test
We conduct a test,
in which we break down the entire flow
into two parts early on,
where one part (control) 
we will offer the service in the current way,
and the other part (the test) 
- in a new, more aggressive way.
The purpose of this test 
is to increase the profitability of the CC + service.

Statistical inputs.
The homogeneity check of the chosen parameter
is performed with a significance level of 2%.

The significance level is 5%.
We would like to distinguish 3%
change in the target metric
with 85% probability.
